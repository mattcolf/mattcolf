### Hi, I'm Matt :wave:

I'm a pragmatic engineering leader with 12+ years of industry experience, a strong technical background, and a history of driving successful solutions in the global supply chain, warehouse management, e-commerce, finance, and higher education domains. 

As an engineer, I specialize in building web applications, web services, developer tooling, and internal tools. However, as a technical leader, I've taken a broader approach that covers all areas of the technical stack needed to drive the right solution for my business partners. I really enjoy working with cross-functional and vertically integrated teams that are empowered to take strong ownership at all levels to build the integrations, services, and user interfaces that are needed to create great user experiences. I have a strong interest in web services, security, software architecture, and keeping things simple and maintainable. I'm also a passionate advocate for DevOps culture, mentoring and growing junior engineers, standards compliance, leading with empathy, and doing the "right thing". Always looking for new interesting and challenging projects.
